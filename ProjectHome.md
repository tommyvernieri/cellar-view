# Cellar View #
Extend the viewing options available from CellarTracker!â„¢ by using Cellar View to display the contents of your wine cellar.

## CellarTracker! ##
You must have a CellarTracker! account to use this project. Create one at [cellartracker.com](http://www.cellartracker.com/).

## Features ##
The wines in your cellar are presented in multiple columns with the wine name, appellation, bin numbers, and price. Wines are organized by type and varietal, with automatic simplifications for similar types of wine. Superfluous parts of wine appellations are not displayed.
