# Overview #
Cellar View takes several steps to simplify the information presented about wines in your cellar. It displays a list of your wines, organized in a way that makes it easy to find what you're looking for without being overwhelmed by information.

## Simplified wine categorization ##
### Wines are grouped by type ###
To optimize for cellars that have few sparkling and rosé wines, those wines are grouped together with whites. Red wines are in another group. There is also a top-level grouping for dessert wines and one for other wines that do not fit into these categories.

All sparkling wines are listed together, regardless or color and varietal. Rosé wines are presented in the same way.

### Wines are grouped by varietal ###
Within each top-level grouping, wines are grouped by varietal and similar varietals are combined.

For example, wines with a varietal of Cabernet-Syrah Blend are listed under the Red Blend varietal. Wines with a varietal of Red Bordeaux Blend are listed under a Red Blend - Bordeaux varietal so that they appear sorted next to other red blends.

### Appellations are simplified ###
When the country, region, subregion, or appellation can be inferred from the other information, the unnecessary information is not displayed.

For example, USA is omitted since the state name makes it clear that the wine is from America. As another example, redundant information is removed such that an appellation like USA, California, Central Coast, Santa Rita Hills - Sta. Rita Hills is simplified to Central Coast, Sta. Rita Hills.

## Wine information layout ##
